            <p>This fingerstyle-friendly Grand Concert boasts the classic tonewood pairing of 
            solid Indian rosewood back and sides with a Sitka spruce top, and like other Grand 
            Concert body styles, features a slightly shorter 24-7/8-inch scale length to make 
            reaching and fretting notes easier. The compact body is matched by a sonic footprint 
            that will keep the overtones in check, giving the guitar clear tonal definition that 
            works well both for solo and ensemble playing. Taylor’s Expression System® 2 pickup 
            delivers natural-sounding amplified tone for gigging or recording. Aesthetic details 
            include white binding, Renaissance fretboard inlays, a three-ring rosette, and satin 
            finish back and sides with a gloss top. The guitar ships in a Taylor deluxe hardshell 
            case. We have the cutaway and the full body in stock.</p>
            
            <h2>Grill</h2>
            <img src="images/grill.jpg" width="230">
            <p>The Artwood Vintage series now showcases another vintage element by applying an 
            "aging" process to the tonewood : "Thermo Aged™" tone wood, made by a special drying 
            process at a high temperature which is commonly known as "baking" or "torrefaction." 
            We have both the full body dreadnought and the cutaway in stock.</p>

            <img src="images/castiron.jpg" width="230">
            <p>First introduced in 2003, the Songwriter Deluxe Studio combines Gibson’s 
            time-honored bracing patterns of the 1930’s with our original dreadnought shape, 
            providing a supreme tonal quality. Featuring beautiful rosewood back and sides 
            paired with a sitka spruce top. The Songwriter Deluxe Studio is Gibson’s modern 
            rosewood dreadnought with a superior dynamic range. We have both 
            the full body dreadnought and the cutaway in stock.</p>
