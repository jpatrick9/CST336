                    Welcome to JP's Kitchen Accessories! That's short for Josh Patrick. <br/>
                    When most people talk about skills they need to have, cooking might not <br/>
                    immediately come to mind. As a cook, however, I can't help but disagree! <br/>
                    Cooking saves you money and calories, and helps maintain your health! <br/>
                    <br/>
