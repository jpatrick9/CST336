                 History of the C# Programming Language: <br/>
                <p>Began as a project to create a new "C-like object-oriented language," or COOL. Anders Hejlsberg, the
                lead architect at Microsoft, was urged to give it another name due to trademark concerns. When the .NET
                project was announced at the Professional Developers Conference in July 2000, the language was renamed "C#."
                There was much controversy surrounding its introduction to the industry, especially considering its similarities
                to Java in both form and function. Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the differences between it and
                Java became much more pronounced; the introduction of lambda expressions, extension methods, and anonymous classes
                put C# on a much more functional-style programming path. Since then, many C# has seen much use in many different
                areas of computer science, owing much to its simple syntax and incredible ease-of-use.<br/><br/>
