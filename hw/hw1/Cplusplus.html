                 History of the C Programming Language: <br/>
                <p>Like C, C++ was Created at AT&T's Bell Labs, but created by Bjarne Stroustrup almost a decade later. Desirable features
                from other languages (such as Simula, Ada, ML, and ALGOL68) were incorporated into this new language in addition to the 
                many features of C. It was known as "C with classes" until five years after its emergence, when it was finally named "C++".
                The language received a fresh breath of air in 2011 when new standards for its code structure were released. While this served
                to intensify the complexity of the library, it also made the language much more popular for creating GUI applications, generating
                3D graphics, and for managing mathematical simulations.<br/><br/>
