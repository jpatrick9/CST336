                History of the C Programming Language: <br/>
                <p>Created at AT&T's Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s. Its purpose was related to the re-designing
                of the UNIX OS, which would eventually allow it to be used on multiple computers. Ritchie derived much of C's syntax
                from a previous language, known as B, which was high-level but did not process data types and could not make use of
                structures. Because C could utilize both, it quickly began to replace other powerful languages of its time, most notably
                ALGOL and PL/I. Because of its wide-reaching applications, C became a foundation for many languages: C++, Java, JavaScript,
                Go, Rust, Limbo, LPC, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, Verilog and C-shell are several such derivatives.<br/><br/>
